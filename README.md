## Description
Welcome to my Team Profile Generator, this application is perfect for users who want easier access to their team's contact information. After initiating the app, you'll be prompeted to add your team members information. Once completed, the submit button will generate an HTML page that holds cards for all your team members. The card colors will change based on the role chosen.

On round two with node.js, this app was easy to set up but I struggled the most with laying out a path for the outputs(cards and HTML) I had a lot of good ideas that I knew would work but didnt have enough time or experience to research methods. Overall, I would like to compact a lot of the code in the future. Especially by using one card template for all roles.
